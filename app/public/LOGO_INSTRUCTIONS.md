# Apollo Hospital Logo Setup

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Your Logo Here

To display the Apollo Hospitals logo, you need to:

### Step 1: Get Your Logo Image
- Get the Apollo Hospitals logo image file
- It can be PNG, JPG, or SVG format

### Step 2: Save It in This Folder
Save your logo file as: **`apollo-logo.png`**

**File Location:**
```
app/
└── public/
    └── apollo-logo.png    ← Place your logo file here
```

### Step 3: Supported Formats
- **PNG** (recommended) - `apollo-logo.png`
- **JPG/JPEG** - `apollo-logo.jpg`
- **SVG** - `apollo-logo.svg`

### Step 4: After Adding the Logo
1. Save the file in `app/public/` folder
2. Refresh your browser
3. The logo will appear automatically!

## Current File Structure:
```
app/
├── public/
│   ├── apollo-logo.png    ← ADD YOUR LOGO HERE
│   └── README.md
├── components/
│   └── ApolloLogo.tsx
└── ...
```

## If You Have a Different Format:
- If your logo is `.jpg`, rename it to `apollo-logo.jpg` and update the component
- If your logo is `.svg`, rename it to `apollo-logo.svg` and update the component

## Need Help?
The logo file must be in the `app/public/` directory and named `apollo-logo.png` (or the format you're using).
